# Development of spatial knowledge graphs for improved visualization and analysis of supply chains:
# A geoinformatics approach for sustainability and resilience

**Project overview**: Master's thesis at the University of Augsburg u and in cooperation with Esri Germany, I am developing an advanced model for the integration of 
Spatial Knowledge Graphs into supply chain management. The aim is to significantly improve the efficiency, sustainability, and resilience of supply chains. 
Particularly in addressing and analyzing geo-risks, this project leverages expert environmental insights to further enhance our understanding and management of 
supply chain vulnerabilities.

**Problem**: Companies face multiple challenges, including ensuring compliance with international standards and minimizing environmental risks and geopolitical uncertainties. 
Traditional data management systems are often unable to adequately visualize and analyze the complex and dynamic relationships within modern supply chains.

**Solution**: This project implements Spatial Knowledge Graphs for the comprehensive, dynamic and spatially oriented visualization of supply chains. 
These graphs integrate detailed geospatial data that goes far beyond simple location information and captures environmental influences, risks and interactions between different nodes in the supply chain.

**Timeline**: 14.05.2024 - 14.11.2024
